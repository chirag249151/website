    <h1>Peaky Blinders</h1>
    <p>
        The infamy of the group and its distinctive name may simply have come from local slang at the time using ‘blinder’ as a description for someone looking particularly striking in appearance. Wherever the name came from, it stuck and would become a namesake for gangs long after the Peaky Blinders demise.
        
        Stephen McHickieStephen McHickie, Peaky Blinder.
        The origins of this gang and others similar to it, came from the poor living conditions and economic hardships which dominated industrial England during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Poverty was a principal cause for the formation of gangs which began with young boys who took up pickpocketing as a way of earning money.
        
        
        The slums of Britain, particularly in the Midlands and northern England, were faced with large scale deprivation and poverty; for young boys and men not in work and with little job prospects, pinching, mugging and criminal acts became a way of life.
